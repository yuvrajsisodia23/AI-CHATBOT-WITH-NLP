# Description

## Natural Language Processing Based Chatbot

### Project Objective:

This project focuses on building a simple AI-powered chatbot using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes popular libraries like **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit) or **spaCy** to process user input and return relevant responses.

The chatbot is capable of:

* Understanding textual input
* Tokenizing and analyzing user queries
* Searching for relevant responses from a corpus
* Replying in a conversational tone

## Technologies & Libraries Used:

| Tool / Library | Purpose                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Python         | Core programming language           |
| NLTK / spaCy   | Natural Language Processing         |
| Regex          | Text cleaning and preprocessing     |
| Random         | Randomized greetings                |
| String         | Formatting text                     |
| Logging        | Tracking bot activity and debugging |

---

## How It Works:

1. **Corpus Setup**:

   * A text file (`corpus.txt`) is prepared containing knowledge on a topic.
   * This file acts as the information source for the bot.

2. **Tokenization**:

   * Sentences and words are tokenized using `sent_tokenize()` and `word_tokenize()` from NLTK.

3. **Preprocessing**:

   * Converts text to lowercase
   * Removes punctuation
   * Applies lemmatization to simplify word forms

4. **Greeting Detection**:

   * If a user's message is a greeting (like "hello" or "hi"), the bot responds with a predefined reply.

5. **Response Generation**:

   * Uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical format
   * Measures cosine similarity to match the user’s query to the closest sentence in the corpus

6. **Interactive Loop**:

   * The conversation continues until the user types an exit command like "bye" or "exit".

## How to Run:

1. **Install Dependencies**:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

2. **Download NLTK Resources**:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

3. **Run the Script**:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

---

## Sample Interaction:

```
USER: Hello
BOT: Hello! How can I assist you?

USER: Tell me about Python
BOT: Python is a high-level programming language known for its readability and versatility.

USER: Bye
BOT: Goodbye! Take care.
```

---

## Features:

* Simple interactive chatbot using basic NLP
* Easily extensible with more data
* Uses cosine similarity to match queries to responses
* Can recognize greetings and respond appropriately

---

## Customization Tips:

* **Replace corpus.txt** with your own domain-specific content
* **Modify the greeting logic** to suit your preferred tone or style
* **Add functionality** like context memory or user name recognition
* **Use spaCy** instead of NLTK for more advanced NLP capabilities

---

## Limitations:

* Cannot remember past queries (no session memory)
* Based only on pattern matching; lacks true comprehension
* Static corpus — does not learn or evolve
* Performance degrades with very large datasets

## Completion Criteria:

* Must respond to user queries based on provided corpus
* Must detect and reply to greetings
* Must include basic NLP operations (tokenization, lemmatization, similarity)
* Clean, readable, and well-documented code
